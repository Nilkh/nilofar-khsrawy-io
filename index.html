    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Coming from a family of eight siblings in Kabul, Afghanistan, I've embraced the spirit of hard work from an early
        age,
        instilled by my mother. Arriving in America, I'm fueled by boundless opportunities. Having recently learned
        coding, I'm
        now poised to secure my first tech role, determined to manifest the future my mother envisioned for me.
    </p>
    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <p>My projects are :
        1: Store or E-commerce-project.
        2: My-react-app.
        3: translateAPI.
        4: WeatherAppAPI.
        ETC....
